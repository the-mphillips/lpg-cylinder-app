-- Fix storage RLS policies for image uploads
-- This script adds policies to allow authenticated users to upload images

-- Enable RLS on storage.objects if not already enabled

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow authenticated users to read from app-data" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow authenticated users to read from user-data" ON storage.objects;
